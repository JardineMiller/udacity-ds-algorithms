# Complexity
* Time: O(n)
* Space: O(n)

# Explanation
Time: The spec for this problem required the solution to be achieved within a single traversal of the input array. The worst case scenario of this solution is O(n).

Space: We are sort the input array in place and not creating any new elements/collections etc therefore the space complexity for this solution is also O(n).
