# Complexity
* Time: O(log n)
* Space: O(1)

# Explanation
Time: This solution utilises a binary search based approach the finding the square root of a provided number. The time complexity of a binary search is O(log n) so the same complexity applies here.

Space: We are only ever storing a maximum of 4 items to memory in the sqrt() method, regardless of the size of the input. That means our space complexity here is a constant and thus can be represented as O(1).
